## Who am I?

My name is Rob Light and I'm a DevOps Engineer based in South Wales, UK.

I've been into computing since I was a lad, and have learned something new almost every day; applying my
life-long learning attitude.

I love most things IT but my main interests are in Automation, IT Infrastructure, and experimenting with new
technologies.
